         <p id = "size">Trafalgar Plaza Building is a commercial building that was created in 1994 inside the Salcedo Village in Makati City, which was considered as one of the leading cities in Metro Manila, Philippines. The company offers residents of Salcedo Village the comfortability and affordability by providing an exceptional service that ensures the life that is deserved by the residents as they nourish and capture wonderful memories and experience with their loved ones. The people behind the creation of this company were very wise and strategic because many different companies across the world are emerging in the country and giving different services to people and yet getting their own unit/office space on this commercial building which is strategically-located within Makati was worth every cent they commit. The commercial building is also said to be within a convenient and easy to access distance from restaurants, schools, malls, and etc., which was an ideal place for people to start a family or professionals looking for a great place to live near their work and also for schools. The success of the company is still going on right now.
